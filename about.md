My name is Birinder Singh and I'm a graduate student studying Master of Data Science at The University of British Columbia.
I have a Master's degree in geophysics from the Indian Institute of technology, Roorkee India. I worked for Schlumberger from 2013-2018.
I am travel enthusiast. Having geology background i got a chance to stay close to the nature more often.
Working Oil Industry was too exciting. We used to drill oil wells in every possible terrain be it Ocean floor 5 km depth, Mountains or Desert.
I realized the scope of automation in my industry which brought me to explore the field of Data Science and hence I joined the MDS program at The UBC.
