Journey through the Mountains
This blog is about my life as a student of Geology at Indian Institiute of Technology Roorkee. My geology trips, seismic surveys with my batchmates. My offshore experience on the research cruise to the Jan Mayaen island and our search for the Black smokers.

To start with here is the beautiful picture of the Sunset i took aboard the vessel at 73 degree N latitude.
